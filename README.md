# -Apple-iPhone-Sales-Analytics-using-Python
 In this analytics project with python, I dived into Apple iPhone sales data to uncover insights related to top-selling models and top models according to their rating and reviews based on discount percentage and sale as well. Leveraging a combination of data analytics techniques, I focused on three key aspects:

Rating and Reviews Analysis:
I examined customer reviews and ratings for various iPhone models.
By aggregating sentiment scores and analyzing patterns, I identified which iPhones received the most positive feedback.
Insights from this analysis can guide marketing strategies and product improvements.

Discount Percentage Investigation:
I explored the relationship between discounts and sales performance.
By calculating discount percentages for different iPhone versions, I determined how pricing impacts consumer behavior.
These findings can inform pricing strategies and promotional campaigns.

Top-Selling Models Identification:
Using sales volume data, I ranked iPhone models based on their popularity.
I considered factors such as seasonality, product launches, and market trends.
The results highlight the iPhones driving revenue and market share.
